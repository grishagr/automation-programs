Programs I developed to automate my day-to-day tasks

## conference-room-auto
Google Apps script that fetches events from two conference room calendars, formats and puts these events on the Google Doc template. As a student assistant at Dean of Students Office at Hamilton College, this was a daily task given to me. The script is run twice a day (for today's and tomorrow's schedule) with time driven triggers. Saves a few minutes of manual work every day.
